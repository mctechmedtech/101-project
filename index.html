              <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
              <div class="half-width">
                <p>I've made my home base in Chester County, Pennsylvania with my family. My journey into tech started with a degree in biology followed by a degree in medical technology. During my years as a clinical laboratory scientist in a community hospital I became acutely aware of the importance of maintaining one's health and became very interested in nutrition, fitness and community: the pillars of optimal health. My research led me to a world of like-minded individuals who are trying to improve the health and wellness of as many people as possible through nutrition and prevention. </p>
              </div>
              <div class="half-width">
                <p>I wanted to learn how to build my own site in order to share all of the valuable information that I've acquired and to help others in the wellness community do the same.  I learned to code and now I'm hooked! It opened a new door. When I learned to build my first website, I realized that I had found something that would provide freedom & versatility in my work and it's something that I love to do! Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

                  <h3>Hand-Coded<br>HTML</h3>
                  <p> My focus is writing clean, well<br>formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand<br>to make sure that the content is easy<br>to read, easy to collaborate,<br>trouble-shoot and accesible.</p>

                    <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is<br>easy to read and build on. I focus on<br>keeping my CSS lean and fast to load,<br>and I make a habit to stay up to<br>date on current best practices.</p>
